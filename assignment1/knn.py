# 
# The kNN classifier consists of two stages:
# 
# - During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply remembers it
# - During testing, kNN classifies every test image by comparing to all training images and transfering the labels of the k most similar training examples
# - The value of k is cross-validated
# 
# In this exercise you will implement these steps and understand the basic Image Classification pipeline, cross-validation, and gain proficiency in writing efficient, vectorized code.

from cs231n.classifiers import KNearestNeighbor

# Create a kNN classifier instance. 
# Remember that training a kNN classifier is a noop: 
# the Classifier simply remembers the data and does no further processing 
classifier = KNearestNeighbor()
classifier.train(X_train, y_train)


# We would now like to classify the test data with the kNN classifier. Recall that we can break down this process into two steps: 
# 
# 1. First we must compute the distances between all test examples and all train examples. 
# 2. Given these distances, for each test example we find the k nearest examples and have them vote for the label
# 
# Lets begin with computing the distance matrix between all training and test examples. For example, if there are **Ntr** training examples and **Nte** test examples, this stage should result in a **Nte x Ntr** matrix where each element (i,j) is the distance between the i-th test and j-th train example.
# 
# **Note: For the three distance computations that we require you to implement in this notebook, you may not use the np.linalg.norm() function that numpy provides.**
# 
# First, open `cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py` and implement the function `compute_distances_two_loops` that uses a (very inefficient) double loop over all pairs of (test, train) examples and computes the distance matrix one element at a time.

# In[ ]:


# Open cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py and implement
# compute_distances_two_loops.

# Test your implementation:
dists = classifier.compute_distances_two_loops(X_test)
print(dists.shape)


# In[ ]:


# We can visualize the distance matrix: each row is a single test example and
# its distances to training examples
plt.imshow(dists, interpolation='none')
plt.show()


# **Inline Question 1** 
# 
# Notice the structured patterns in the distance matrix, where some rows or columns are visible brighter. (Note that with the default color scheme black indicates low distances while white indicates high distances.)
# 
# - What in the data is the cause behind the distinctly bright rows?
# - What causes the columns?

# Now implement the function predict_labels and run the code below:
# We use k = 1 (which is Nearest Neighbor).
y_test_pred = classifier.predict_labels(dists, k=1)

# Compute and print the fraction of correctly predicted examples
num_correct = np.sum(y_test_pred == y_test)
accuracy = float(num_correct) / num_test
print('Got %d / %d correct => accuracy: %f' % (num_correct, num_test, accuracy))


# You should expect to see approximately `27%` accuracy. Now lets try out a larger `k`, say `k = 5`:

# In[ ]:


y_test_pred = classifier.predict_labels(dists, k=5)
num_correct = np.sum(y_test_pred == y_test)
accuracy = float(num_correct) / num_test
print('Got %d / %d correct => accuracy: %f' % (num_correct, num_test, accuracy))


# You should expect to see a slightly better performance than with `k = 1`.

# **Inline Question 2**
# 
# We can also use other distance metrics such as L1 distance.
# For pixel values $p_{ij}^{(k)}$ at location $(i,j)$ of some image $I_k$, 
# 
# the mean $\mu$ across all pixels over all images is $$\mu=\frac{1}{nhw}\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{j=1}^{w}p_{ij}^{(k)}$$
# And the pixel-wise mean $\mu_{ij}$ across all images is 
# $$\mu_{ij}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^np_{ij}^{(k)}.$$
# The general standard deviation $\sigma$ and pixel-wise standard deviation $\sigma_{ij}$ is defined similarly.
# 
# Which of the following preprocessing steps will not change the performance of a Nearest Neighbor classifier that uses L1 distance? Select all that apply.
# 1. Subtracting the mean $\mu$ ($\tilde{p}_{ij}^{(k)}=p_{ij}^{(k)}-\mu$.)
# 2. Subtracting the per pixel mean $\mu_{ij}$  ($\tilde{p}_{ij}^{(k)}=p_{ij}^{(k)}-\mu_{ij}$.)
# 3. Subtracting the mean $\mu$ and dividing by the standard deviation $\sigma$.
# 4. Subtracting the pixel-wise mean $\mu_{ij}$ and dividing by the pixel-wise standard deviation $\sigma_{ij}$.
# 5. Rotating the coordinate axes of the data.

# Now lets speed up distance matrix computation by using partial vectorization
# with one loop. Implement the function compute_distances_one_loop and run the
# code below:
dists_one = classifier.compute_distances_one_loop(X_test)

# To ensure that our vectorized implementation is correct, we make sure that it
# agrees with the naive implementation. There are many ways to decide whether
# two matrices are similar; one of the simplest is the Frobenius norm. In case
# you haven't seen it before, the Frobenius norm of two matrices is the square
# root of the squared sum of differences of all elements; in other words, reshape
# the matrices into vectors and compute the Euclidean distance between them.
difference = np.linalg.norm(dists - dists_one, ord='fro')
print('One loop difference was: %f' % (difference, ))
if difference < 0.001:
    print('Good! The distance matrices are the same')
else:
    print('Uh-oh! The distance matrices are different')

# Now implement the fully vectorized version inside compute_distances_no_loops
# and run the code
dists_two = classifier.compute_distances_no_loops(X_test)

# check that the distance matrix agrees with the one we computed before:
difference = np.linalg.norm(dists - dists_two, ord='fro')
